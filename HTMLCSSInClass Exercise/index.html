        <p>Welcome to my homepage! I hope you're doing great, in this paragraph I will briefly talk about who I am. As you may know
        my name is Calvin Ye and I am a current Junior at Bentley University pursuing in a Bachelor Degree majoring in Computer Science
        and minoring in Finance. I am involved in a few on campus activities which include Delta Sigma Iota Fraternity, Bentley Association
        of Chinese Students, Bentley Asian Student Association, Bentley Student of Gaming, and I was a part of the Bentley Swim and Dive.
        I am from Port Washington, NY which is a town located on Long Island. I have two older sisters, Ashley and Charmaine who graduated from Boston University
        and I live with my mom and dad, Shirley and Stephen. Some hobbies I enjoy doing are going to the gym, play video games, watch
        YouTube or sports games especially Football, and hangout with friends which is either going out, playing video games or poker.
        Growing up I played many sports which are swimming, soccer, basketball, and volleyball. Hopefully you learned a bit about me, and
        I hope you enjoy looking at my Home Page.</p>

        <p>Here is a picture of myself this summer, as you can see I am very tan in this picture due to my jobs
        which were being a head swim coach and swimming private lessons. At this time of the photo, I believe I was
        playing poker with my friends!</p>
